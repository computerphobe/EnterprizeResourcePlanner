3. `frontend/src/pages/Invoice/index.jsx` - Added hospital & patient name columns
4. `frontend/src/pages/hospital/SalesBill.jsx` - Added patient name column

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works:**

### Doctor Registration:
1. User selects "Doctor" role
2. Hospital name field appears and becomes required
3. Both Admin and Client records are created with hospital name

### Order/Invoice Creation:
1. Hospital/Doctor creates an invoice/order
2. Patient name field is available (optional)
3. Data is saved and displayed in admin panels and delivery sections

### Admin/Delivery View:
1. Admin sees hospital name for doctors and patient names for all orders
2. Deliverers see hospital names and patient names for proper delivery routing
3. All historical data remains intact with backward compatibility

## ðŸš€ **Benefits:**
- **Better Organization**: Know which hospital each doctor belongs to
- **Patient Tracking**: Track orders by patient name
- **Delivery Efficiency**: Deliverers know exactly where to deliver orders
- **Admin Oversight**: Complete visibility of hospital-doctor-patient relationships
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing data continues to work
