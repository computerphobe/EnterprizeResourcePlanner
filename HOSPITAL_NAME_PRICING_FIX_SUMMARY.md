# Hospital Name and Pricing Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hospital Name Display Issue
**Problem**: Hospital names were showing as "Unknown Hospital" in various places including:
- Deliverer's CurrentOrders modal
- Admin order listings
- Doctor order history

**Solution**: 
- Updated all order-related endpoints (`delivererOrders`, `ownerOrders`, `doctorOrders`) with fallback logic for hospitalName
- Created and ran `fix-hospital-name-orders.js` script to populate missing hospitalName values in existing orders
- Fixed 10 orders with proper hospital names

**Backend Changes**:
- `backend/src/controllers/appControllers/orderController/index.js`: Enhanced all order endpoints with hospitalName fallback logic
- Added database script to fix existing order records

### 2. Pricing Display Issue
**Problem**: Order prices were showing as ₹0.00 everywhere because:
- Frontend was sending `price: 0` for all items
- Backend wasn't calculating actual prices from inventory items
- Existing orders had no pricing information

**Solution**:
- Updated `createDoctorOrder` endpoint to fetch actual prices from inventory items
- Enhanced price calculation logic in order creation
- Created and ran `fix-order-pricing.js` script to populate missing prices in existing orders
- Fixed 8 out of 10 orders with proper pricing (2 orders had missing/invalid inventory items)

**Backend Changes**:
- `backend/src/controllers/appControllers/orderController/index.js`: Enhanced `createDoctorOrder` with proper price calculation
- Added database script to fix existing order pricing

### 3. Returns and Substitution Display Enhancement
**Problem**: Deliverer's order modal didn't show detailed information about:
- Returned items quantities and values
- Substitution details with pricing
- Clear breakdown of what was returned vs. what was used

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `delivererOrders` endpoint to include completed orders (so deliverers can see full history)
- Added comprehensive return information calculation including:
  - Item-by-item return quantities
  - Return values based on item prices
  - Total return summary
- Enhanced frontend modal with detailed return and substitution displays

**Frontend Changes**:
- `frontend/src/pages/delivery/CurrentOrders.jsx`: 
  - Enhanced order items display with unit prices and totals
  - Added detailed returns information section
  - Improved substitution details with better formatting
  - Added pricing breakdown for each returned item

**Backend Changes**:
- `backend/src/controllers/appControllers/orderController/index.js`: Enhanced `delivererOrders` to include comprehensive return data

## Database Updates Performed

1. **Hospital Names**: Updated 10 orders with proper hospital names
2. **Order Pricing**: Updated 8 orders with calculated pricing (₹1,234 to ₹44,400 range)
3. **Status**: Now showing completed orders in deliverer view for full transparency
