# Order Item Substitution Fix - Simple Approach

## Problem
- Frontend was sending stale `orderItemId` values that didn't match current database state
- Complex refresh strategies were unreliable and overly complicated

## Solution
**Use inventory item ID instead of order item ID for lookups**

### Changes Made:

#### Backend (`orderController/index.js`)
- Changed parameter from `orderItemId` to `inventoryItemId`
- Find order items by matching `item.inventoryItem._id` instead of `item._id`
- This eliminates ID synchronization issues completely

#### Frontend (`OrderList.jsx`)
- Simplified `handleSubstitution` function
- Send `inventoryItemId: selectedItem.inventoryItem._id` instead of order item ID
- Removed complex refresh logic
- Much cleaner and more reliable approach

### Why This Works:
1. **Inventory item IDs are stable** - they don't change when orders are modified
2. **No synchronization needed** - we always use the current stable identifier
3. **Simpler logic** - fewer moving parts means fewer failure points
4. **More reliable** - inventory items have a one-to-one relationship with order items

### Test Steps:
1. Start backend and frontend
2. Navigate to Orders Management
3. Click "View & Substitute" on any order
4. Click "Substitute" on any order item
5. Select a return item and quantity
6. Click "Confirm Substitution"
7. Should work without 404 errors

The fix is much cleaner than the previous complex refresh approach!
