# Hospital/Doctor Invoice Viewing Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation for displaying hospital and doctor invoices in the ERP system's SalesBill section. This allows hospitals and doctors to view their invoice history and download invoice PDFs. The system now includes automatic client registration for users who don't have existing client records.

## Implementation Details

### Backend

1. **Client Management Utilities**:
   - Added `clientUtils.js` with comprehensive client management functions
   - Functions for finding, creating, and updating client records
   - Automatic client registration when a user ID doesn't exist in the client database

2. **Client Invoices Controller**:
   - Updated to use the new client utilities for robust client handling
   - Automatically creates client records for users who don't have them
   - Added fallback mechanisms to handle ObjectId errors
   - Returns client information including whether a new client was created

3. **API Routes**:
   - Added routes for hospital/doctor invoice viewing:
     - GET `/hospital/sales-bills` for hospital users
     - GET `/doctor/sales-bills` for doctor users
   - Added debugging endpoint for admins:
     - GET `/admin/client-invoices/:clientId` to look up invoices by client ID
   - Added manual client creation endpoint:
     - POST `/admin/client/find-or-create` for admins to manually create client records

4. **Payment Controller**:
   - Ensures that invoices are marked as "sent" when payment is recorded
   - Guarantees that invoices appear in client bill sections

### Frontend

1. **Hospital/Doctor SalesBill Pages**:
   - Display invoices in a table with filtering tabs
   - Include invoice details modal with item breakdown
   - Support PDF download for invoice documents
   - Show welcome notification when a new client record is created

2. **Admin Invoice Debugger**:
   - Added a new tool for administrators to look up invoices by client ID
   - Helps troubleshoot issues when clients can't see their invoices
   - Accessible at `/admin/invoice-debugger`

### Auto-Registration Feature

The system now automatically creates client records when:
1. A hospital or doctor user accesses their sales bills for the first time
2. No existing client record is found for their user ID
3. The system creates a new client record with their user information

This ensures that:
- All users can access their invoice section without manual setup
- Client records are properly linked to user accounts
- Invoice associations work correctly from the first login

### Testing Scripts

1. **Invoice Endpoint Tester**:
   - Added a script for testing the invoice endpoints (`test-invoice-endpoints.js`)
   - Tests hospital/doctor sales-bills endpoints and admin client lookup

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. ObjectId Constructor Error

**Problem**: The error "TypeError: Class constructor ObjectId cannot be invoked without 'new'" occurs when trying to convert a string ID to a MongoDB ObjectId.

**Solution**: 
- First try to find the client record directly
- Use the direct client ID in the query when possible
- Fall back to filtering all invoices when needed

### 2. Invoices Not Appearing in Client Views

**Problem**: Invoices not showing up in the hospital/doctor sales bill section.

**Solution**:
- Ensure payment recording updates invoice status to "sent"
- Check client document has correct userId linked
- Verify invoice created with correct client reference

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the robustness of the invoice fetching logic
2. Consider adding more filtering options for large invoice lists
3. Implement pagination for performance with large datasets
